[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findobstacles_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "obstacles_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "obstacles_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    obstacles_msgsConfig.cmake
    obstacles_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "obstacles_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "obstacles_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "obstacles_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
